# Merge Sort
Merge sort in Python.

```text
if length of array is greater than 1:
    separate array
    recursively sort array
    iterative over subarrays to add back together
    once unions are added, add lower, then higher
return array
```

Notes:
- divide and conquer -> divide problem, solve subproblems, and put subs back together
